# Flappy Dragon (in Rust)

This is the basic flappy dragon game outlined in Part 1 of Herbert Wolverson's "Hands-on Rust" 

The book is available to purchase [from the Pragmatic Programmers Website](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/).

If you'd like to build this program, you'll need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

Then you can clone this repo, navigate to the `flappy` folder and use `cargo run`. It should then open in your default terminal.

Follow the instructions in-game to play.
